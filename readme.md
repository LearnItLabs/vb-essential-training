### Description
Visual Basic is one of the core Microsoft languages for building desktop, mobile, and web applications. This course was designed to help you start programming with Visual Basic using Visual Studio. Join instructor Walt Ritscher as he provides an overview of Hello World applications for three common application architectures: console, desktop, and Windows Store apps. Along the way, discover the core concepts and technical skills required to use a variety of language fundamentals including classes, data types, operators, strings, looping constructs, conditionals, exceptions, and lists.

## Instructions
This repository contains example code for most of the videos in the course, organized into branches.

You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and view the code at that stage of the course. Alternatively, you can directly access a specific branch by adding `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL.
## Branches in Visual Studio
While following along with the course, you can use Visual Studio's Git tools to switch between branches. This allows you to easily move to the relevant chapter and topic as you progress through the course. 

## Branch Names
The branches are structured to correspond to the chapters in the course. Each branch is named using the format `Chapter#-Topic-Name`. For example, the branch named `02-Avoid-SideEffects` corresponds to the second chapter of the course, which includes a video on avoiding side effects in functional programming. 

To determine which branch to open, refer to the popup displayed at the start of each video.


## Installing  
To use these exercise files, follow the instructions in the course to learn how to work with GitHub content.
